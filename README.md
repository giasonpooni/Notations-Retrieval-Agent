# Schematics Retrieval Agent

Function-graph plus factor-graph IR for setting up observers on declared
nonlinear plants. The agent retrieves typed subgraphs, applies an eligibility
table, and writes fail-closed annotations.

Short name **SRA**. The reusable library import is `schematics`.

OpenUSD is a projection. This package is not a twin platform and does not
import JSPT, PLSR, RCI, or CSE at module load.

The central question is:

> Given an authored schematic, which subgraphs may call which kernel —
> and what remains UNRESOLVED?

## Install and run

Python 3.12 or 3.13.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/giasonpooni/Schematics-Retrieval-Agent.git
cd Schematics-Retrieval-Agent
uv run --python 3.13 python examples/quickstart.py
uv run --python 3.13 python examples/unknown_plant.py
uv run --python 3.13 --with pytest pytest -q
```

CLI:

```bash
uv run --python 3.13 sra --fixture-A -o results
uv run --python 3.13 --extra jspt sra --call-jspt -o results
uv run --python 3.13 sra --rci-digest rci-displacement-digest-fixture -o results
```

`--extra jspt` installs the pinned `sensitivity` package into the same environment
that runs `--call-jspt`. Without that extra, an unavailable kernel returns
`NOT_CHECKED`. A fixture A does not open PLSR.

To exercise all pinned companion adapters, including the JSPT-to-PLSR path:

```bash
uv run --python 3.13 --dev --extra kernels pytest -q -m live
```

Explicit live tests require their dependencies and fail if one is absent. The
default suite excludes live tests; its missing-dependency cases simulate that
condition even when extras are installed.
